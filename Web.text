Project Description
The proposed Via Verdi Slope Stabilization Project (project) has been designed by the City of Richmond (City) to reconstruct a segment of the Via Verdi roadway that was damaged by a landslide in 2017; the road was closed at that time and an emergency roadway continues to provide access for the Sobrante Glen neighborhood. Reconstruction of the roadway requires installation of a culvert within San Pablo Creek, backfilled with engineered fill, to buttress the landslide and provide a stabilized footing for the roadway embankment. An offsite mitigation area is included as part of the project.
